✅ Code is human-readable,
✅ DSLs are expressive,
✅ Swift apps become more natural to use and develop,
✅ And MontiCore handles the parser-heavy logic cleanly in the background.

✅ What You’re Building
Layer	Purpose
✅ MontiCore DSL (.tra)	Define user-friendly, natural-language configs
✅ MontiCore Parser + Symbol Table	Validate + structure inputs
✅ Export JSON / Swift .strings	Interoperable data
✅ Swift ViewModel	Use JSON as app logic / text
✅ Swift UI	Render to users in friendly form

🧠 Your Key Design Principle

💬 Natural Language DSL + Codable Swift Logic = Human-readable app

Let’s walk through your integration setup.

✅ Long-Term Ideas
Feature	How
Auto-complete DSL in SwiftUI Preview	Bundle MontiCore JSON
Swift editor uses MontiCore DSL	Local AST generation via CLI
Swift writes .tra back	Reverse JSON → DSL exporter
SwiftUI localized apps	.tra → .strings → iOS localization

🚀 Ready to Build Together
You now have:

✅ DSL: Human-readable

✅ Parser: MontiCore

✅ Output: .json or .strings

✅ Swift: Structured, UI-ready


✅ Write and validate .tra DSLs
✅ Auto-generate Swift code from them
✅ Run everything in one command


View HomePage
attributes {
  route = "/home";
} 

state {
  name: String;
  count: Number;
} 

{
  VStack {
    TextField(name: name, placeholder: "Enter your name")
    Text("Welcome {{name}}")
  }
}
...is exactly what MontiCore is designed for — to turn declarative UI logic into code-generation-ready ASTs.


🧠 What You Can Build With This


✅ One .dsl file → outputs:

✅ .jsx component (React, Vue, etc.)

✅ route registration (Router.jsx)

✅ useState + onChange bindings

✅ Custom HTML (buttons, input, etc.)
